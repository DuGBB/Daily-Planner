# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
## Week 5. Third-party APIs Challenge:Work Day Scheduler

Week fives challenge goal was to create a daily planner using JavaScript and provided starter code.

I did this bye:
- displaying the current day at the top of the page
- creating a table to display time blocks for standard business hours
- color coding each time block to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future using Moment.js, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
- creating a text area to enter an event
- creating a button to save/retrieve data from local storage
- used local storage to make saved events persist a page refresh
